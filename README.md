A full-stack Personal Finance Tracker application that allows users to manage their income, expenses, and transactions. The app is built with Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Redis for caching. Users can authenticate via JWT and perform CRUD operations on their financial transactions.

Features
User Authentication: Register and log in with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication.
Transaction Management: Users can add, update, delete, and retrieve income and expense transactions.
PostgreSQL Database: All user and transaction data is stored securely in a PostgreSQL database.
Redis Caching: Frequently accessed data (like transaction lists) is cached using Redis to optimize performance.
Scalable API: Built as a RESTful API, making it easy to expand and integrate with other services.
Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: PostgreSQL (with Sequelize ORM)
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Password Hashing: bcrypt.js
Caching: Redis
